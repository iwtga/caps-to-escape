# caps-to-escape

A tiny script to remap the <b>useless</b> caps key to the escape key.
Useful primarily for VIM users.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repo.
2. ```chmod +x capstoescape.sh```
3. ```./capstoescape.sh```
4. Enjoy

## Note:
1. You will have to run the script each time you reboot your machine.
2. If you are using the Vim Extension on VS code and the remapping isn't working, paste ```"keyboard.dispatch": "keyCode"``` in ```settings.json``` and restart VS Code.
3. If you face any issues or want to suggest any improvements or have any questions, feel free to raise an issue!
